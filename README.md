# GIFT2ME

Welcome to GIFT2ME! 

A simple website designed to allow users to create events where they can share a gift wishlist with their friends and family!
Upon visiting the site users are greeted with a simple homepage. From there they can choose to login or register if they don't already have an account from the navigation bar.
After registering, users are immediately logged in and redirected to their dashboard. Notice the customized welcome message in the navigation bar once a user logs in.

From the dashboard users can press the create event button to be navigated to the create event page. From there they can input event details then start adding gifts they would like to receive.
All fields must be entered or an alert message will stop the user from creating the event.
Once an event and gifts have been added the user is also able to edit either the event details or gift by clicking the edit buttons.
A modal will appear with input fields for editing.

Back on the dashboard a user can share, edit or delete an event. Pressing the share icon will open the users email with a autofilled message featuring the link to that respective event's wishlist.
Friends or family that go to the share link can then reserve items on the wishlist by selecting the quantity they want to buy.

When the quantity of an item hits zero the item will be reserved and can no longer be selected by other guests.
A resevered badge will appear on that specific gift.
